            This application focuses on models based on data-dependent distributions without 
            making strong assumptions about the underlying distribution.
            
            #### Key Assumptions:
            - Sample Size: n observations
            - Nature of Sample: Independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
            - Distribution Type: Continuous, but unspecified
            
            This represents a complete data situation.
