            The Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) is a step function that increases by 1/n at each of the n data points. It's used to estimate the cumulative distribution function of a random variable.

            #### How to Calculate ECDF:
            1. **Sort the data** in ascending order: x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, ..., x‚Çô
            2. **For each value x:**
               - Calculate F(x) = (number of observations ‚â§ x) / (total number of observations)
            
            #### Properties of ECDF:
            - It ranges from 0 to 1
            - It is a step function
            - It increases only at observed data points
            - It is right-continuous
            
            #### When to Use ECDF:
            - To visualize the distribution of your data
            - To compare different distributions
            - To identify percentiles and quantiles
            - To detect outliers or unusual patterns

        st.markdown("""
            An Ogive is a graphical representation of a cumulative frequency distribution for grouped data. It's created by plotting the upper boundaries of groups against cumulative frequencies or proportions.

            #### How to Calculate Ogive:
            1. **Organize data** into groups/classes
            2. **Calculate frequencies** for each group
            3. **Calculate cumulative frequencies**
            4. **Plot points** at the upper boundaries
            
            #### Properties of Ogive:
            - It is a continuous curve
            - It is always increasing (non-decreasing)
            - It connects cumulative frequencies at class boundaries
            - Final value represents total frequency
            
            #### When to Use Ogive:
            - To represent grouped data
            - To find median and quartiles graphically
            - To compare different datasets
            - To analyze trends in cumulative data
